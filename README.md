# SuTaNa Math Engine
Building a Math Engine while practicing 3D Math for game. 

I will continue to add new math classes and methods to existing classes as soon as I am ready to implement them in my Math Engine.

I added the solution file for now so I can just pull and start working in VS 2017. I will remove it when my math engine is ready to implement
in the game engine.
